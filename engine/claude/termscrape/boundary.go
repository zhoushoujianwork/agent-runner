// Turn boundary detection — the crux of the device line.
//
// v1's stream-json delivered an explicit `turn_end` event. Over a PTY there is
// no such signal, so we infer "the assistant finished this turn" from screen
// behaviour. This decides WHEN the device starts TTS playback, so false
// positives (speaking a half-finished reply) and false negatives (never
// speaking) are both bad.
//
// We combine three heuristics, ALL of which must hold for TurnEnded to be true:
//
//  1. Output settled: no new PTY bytes for ~Quiet duration. A reply still
//     streaming in (or a CLI actively redrawing its spinner) keeps producing
//     bytes, so we never call a turn finished while content is moving.
//  2. Prompt returned: the cursor region is back at the CLI's idle input prompt
//     (claude's empty "> " box), not inside a streaming response. When the model
//     is working the prompt box is absent or shows the in-flight question; an
//     idle prompt is the CLI saying "your move".
//  3. Spinner gone: the "thinking…" / "Cogitating…" status line — the one
//     carrying claude's "esc to interrupt" affordance — is no longer on screen.
//     A live spinner is the single most reliable "still busy" signal: claude
//     keeps it up for the entire turn and only clears it when the turn ends.
//
// Why all three, and not just "output settled"? A mid-reply network pause is the
// adversarial case: the model stalls, bytes stop for well over Quiet, yet the
// turn is NOT over. In that state the spinner line is still on screen (claude
// keeps "esc to interrupt" visible while waiting) and the idle prompt has not
// returned. Requiring (2) and (3) on top of (1) rejects that false positive,
// while (1) on its own guards against speaking over a reply that is still
// actively painting.
//
// The spinner / prompt shapes are claude-specific and shared with noise.go
// (promptInterruptHint, isPromptLine). Keeping the detector keyed off the same
// line classifiers means a claude UI change is fixed in one place.
