// Package termscrape interprets the claude CLI's TUI screen semantically —
// ported from bbclaw adapter_v2/internal/extract (same author) so the "how to
// read claude's screen" knowledge lives with the claude engine and its
// contract tests (#12). It scrapes the server-side VT screen for the
// assistant's reply text so the BBClaw device/voice line gets clean plain text
// instead of raw TUI bytes. This is the hardest, most brittle layer in v2:
// stream-json gave us structured events for free; here we reverse-engineer a UI
// meant for human eyes.
//
// Accepted scope (decided): emit plain reply text + coarse busy/idle status
// only. We do NOT attempt to recover thinking blocks, precise tool-approval
// events, dispatch progress, or token counts.
//
// # How extraction works
//
// On every PTY chunk the screen is Fed and then OnOutput is called. We:
//
//  1. Read the whole visible grid as plain text (termscreen.VisibleText).
//  2. Drop "noise" lines — the CLI input-prompt box region, the spinner /
//     progress status line, and box-drawing-only borders — leaving just the
//     conversation content (see noise.go for the per-line classifier).
//  3. Diff the surviving content against the baseline captured when the
//     Extractor was created, so only the NEWEST reply (the lines that appeared
//     after the user's last turn) is kept, not the scrollback above it.
//  4. Emit a Reply only when that extracted text actually changed. Because the
//     spinner is stripped in step 2, the dozens of spinner redraw frames a real
//     `claude` session emits collapse to identical extracted text and produce no
//     duplicate / jittering Replies.
//
// The marker path additionally scans recent scrollback ahead of the visible grid
// (termscreen.ScrollbackText), so a reply TALLER than the terminal — whose "⏺"
// anchor has scrolled off the visible grid — is recovered whole rather than
// truncated to its visible tail (case C9).
//
// Complete is intentionally left false here: deciding when the turn has ended is
// boundary.go's job (#210). This package only proposes the content.
//
// Every screen state this package must handle is catalogued in CASES.md (one row
// per branch, each tied to its test). Add a case there before extending the
// extraction logic.
